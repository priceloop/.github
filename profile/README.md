# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

At priceloop, we are working on a completely novel way of how businesses can run their pricing. Like really really novel. Not just another AI model for pricing but we want to strive to redefine this software category.

In particular, we are building a NoCode platform that enables businesses and IT to work together in a seamless way. Some of our features:

ðŸ§® A powerful spreadsheet that can handle millions of rows

ðŸ§² Many built-in and custom functions: you can easily write external function in Python and use it in the spreadsheet

ðŸ”® Autosuggestion and syntax highlighting when creating formulas; kind of a powerful IDE for spreadsheet formulas

ðŸ”Œ An easy API interface to interact with the spreadsheet
