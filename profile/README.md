# Hi there 👋

At priceloop, we are working on a completely novel way of how businesses can run their pricing. Like really really novel. Not just another AI model for pricing but we want to strive to redefine this software category.

In particular, we are building a NoCode platform that enables businesses and IT to work together in a seamless way. Some of our features:

🧮 A powerful spreadsheet that can handle millions of rows

🧲 Many built-in and custom functions: you can easily write functions in Python/go and use them in spreadsheet formulas

🔮 Autosuggestion and syntax highlighting when creating formulas with type checking; kind of a powerful IDE for spreadsheet formulas

🔌 An easy API interface and command line tool to interact with the spreadsheet

😍 And much more to come (version control, more data integration possibilities etc.)
